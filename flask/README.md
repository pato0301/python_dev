# Stock Centric

This is my final project for the Harvard CS50x

# What it does

This webpage will help small business as well as big companies to manage their product stock, track them and analyze
their products history. How much they have bought of that product, how much they have sold.

## Pages

The first thing you will see is the login page,if you are not login you should go to the register page.
After you have logged in, you will the the Index page, there you will see a sumary of all you existing products.
On top, you will the nav bar, their you can navigate to the input tab (to input how many new products you have bought),
the output tab (to output your product, that is to say, how many product you sell), the new product tab (to insert new product into
the database, and so to be able to buy and sell them).

Also, you will have an analytics tab, where you can see the progress of your product through time in a more visual way
and be able to take business decitions.

In every moment, o the right side of the nav bar, you will have the "Dark Mode" button, to change between the dark mode
and the non-dark mode.

## What will the user needs?

The user will only need to register and he will be ready to go.

# What did I used to build this project?

To build this website I used the skill gain in the CS50x course as well as new things learned while
developing this project.

## Languages and frameworks

For this website I used the Python's framework Flask to build the backend. That is to say,
to input data into the database, to retrieve data from the database as well as a password checker app.

I have also used Jinja to generate a layout HTML file and extended to the rest of the HTML files
and generate custom layouts in the different pages, according to the data pass from the database
to the HTML template.

Furthermore, I used JavaScript for another passworcheck, generate graph in the analytics page
and also for a nowadays very popular feature the "Dark Mode".

Other tool used in the project is the SQL lite to store the data, using SQL language.

Needless to say, that I have also used HTML and CSS.
